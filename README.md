# Android Project â€“ Personal Diary App  

This project is the **final assignment** for my Android Development course.  
It demonstrates the concepts Iâ€™ve learned throughout the course, including:  

- A `MainActivity` as the entry point.  
- Fragment-based navigation (each screen is represented by a fragment).  
- Local data persistence using **Room Database**.  
- UI layout creation using **XML**.

- **Splash Screen**

- **Login Screen** â€“ user logs in with a password (default: empty).  
- **Home Screen** â€“ entry point to the **Entries List** or **Settings**.
